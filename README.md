# Cryptography Scripts Description

## affineCeasar.py

**Description :** 

This Python script decrypts a given ciphertext encrypted using the Affine Caesar Cipher. 

The Affine Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced using a mathematical formula:

To decrypt, the script calculates the modular inverse of ùëé a and applies the decryption formula:
